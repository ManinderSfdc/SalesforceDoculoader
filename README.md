# Salesforce doculoader
Native Bulk File uploader for Salesforce with Review table

**Intructions**
- Use the **Salesforce Doculoader** App
- Upload a file of minimum size when bulk uploading for testing because the sandboxes have storage limits and the upload time also depends on the internet connectivity.
- For **Upload with File Name** scenario the file name should start with the a valid `Portfolio__c.PortfolioNumber__c` and appended with underscore. For example a valid file names are P0000000010_abc, P0000000010_sdfoj, P0000000010_anystring
- For **Upload with Protfolio Type** there is no naming convention for the files.
